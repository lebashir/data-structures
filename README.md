# Common Data Structures:

## Singly Linked List

A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.

Singly Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to next node or null

Singly Linked Lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required.

Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists do not contain a built in index

List Data Structures that consist of nodes are the foundation for other data structures like Stacks and Queues


## Doubly Linked List

Almost identical to Singly Linked Lists, except every node has another pointer, to the previous node;

Doubly Linked List take up more memory than Singly Linked Lists, however they offer more flexibility
